            "Hello Everyone !! As a recent computer science & engineering graduate, 
            I am enthusiastic about entering the world of technology and software
            development. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in
            programming language such as Core Java(J2SE), SQL, Android application 
            Development as well as problem-solving skills that I'm eager to apply
            in real-world scenarios. During my time at TCE, I actively participated in 
            National level Hackathon competition and bagged 2nd runner up , I collaborated
            on projects that honed my skills in algorithmic thinking and software development.
    
            I am particularly excited about web development and have experience
            creating responsive and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            and have more experience creating android applications using XML, java and PHP.
            I can portrait myself as good leader & have management skills since I was 
            Technical Secretary of TCE & Joint Secretary of CSE dept.
            As I embark on my career, I am open to opportunities that will allow me to further
            develop my skills, contribute to innovative projects, and work with a dynamic 
            team of professionals. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated 
            with the latest trends in technology.
            
            If you are looking for a passionate and dedicated entry-level software 
            developer who is eager to make an impact, I would love to connect and explore
            potential collaborations. Let's build the future of technology together."</p>
